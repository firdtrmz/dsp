        Hi there! My name is Abang Mohammad Firdaus.

        This app allows you to upload your data and get visual insights with just a single prompt. However, to run the app, I need your OpenAI API key. 

        If you don't have a key, you can sign up and create one [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

        Once set up, simply upload your data, prompt about it, and see it visualized! âœ¨
